Abstract 
This paper reveals a previously ignored connection between two 
important fields: regularization and independent component anal- 
ysis (ICA). We show that at least one representative of a broad 
class of algorithms (regularizers that reduce network complexity) 
extracts independent features as a by-product. This algorithm is 
Flat Minimum Search (FMS), a recent general method for finding 
low-complexity networks with high generalization capability. FMS 
works by minimizing both training error and required weight pre- 
cision. According to our theoretical analysis the hidden layer of 
an FMS-trained autoassociator attempts at coding each input by 
a sparse code with as few simple features as possible. In experi- 
ments the method extracts optimal codes for difficult versions of 
the "noisy bars" benchmark problem by separating the underlying 
sources, whereas ICA and PCA fail. Real world images are coded 
with fewer bits per pixel than by ICA or PCA. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In the field of unsupervised learning several information-theoretic objective func- 
tions (OFs) have been proposed to evaluate the quality of sensory codes. Most OFs 
focus on properties of the code components -- we refer to them as code component- 
oriented OFs, or COCOFs. Some COCOFs explicitly favor near-factorial, mini- 
mally redundant codes of the input data [2, 17, 23, 7, 24] while others favor local 
codes [22, 3, 15]. Recently there has also been much work on COCOFs encouraging 
biologically plausible sparse distributed codes [19, 9, 25, 8, 6, 21, 11, 16]. 
While COCOFs express desirable properties of the code itself they neglect the costs 
of constructing the code from the data. E.g., coding input data without redun- 
460 S. Hochreiter and d. Schmidhuber 
dancy may be very expensive in terms of information required to describe the code- 
generating network, which may need many finely tuned free parameters. We believe 
that one of sensory coding's objectives should be to reduce the cost of code genera- 
tion through data transformations, and postulate that an important scarce resource 
is the bits required to describe the mappings that generate and process the codes. 
Hence we shift the point of view and focus on the information-theoretic costs of 
code generation. We use a novel approach to unsupervised learning called "low- 
complexity coding and decoding" (LocOCODE [14]). Without assuming particular 
goals such as data compression, subsequent classification, etc., but in the spirit 
of research on minimum description length (MDL), L OCOCOD E generates so-called 
lococodes that (1) convey information about the input data, (2) can be computed 
from the data by a low-complexity mapping (LCM), and (3) can be decoded by an 
LCM. We will see that by minimizing coding/decoding costs LOCOCODE can yield 
efficient, robust, noise-tolerant mappings for processing inputs and codes. 
Lococodes through regularizers. To implement LOCOCODE we apply regular- 
ization to an autoassociator (AA) whose hidden layer activations represent the code. 
The hidden layer is forced to code information about the input data by minimizing 
training error; the regularizer reduces coding/decoding costs. Our regularizer of 
choice will be Flat Minimum Search (FMS) [13]. 
2 FLAT MINIMUM SEARCH: REVIEW AND ANALYSIS 
FMS is a general gradient-based method for finding low-complexity networks with 
high generalization capability. FMS finds a large region in weight space such that 
each weight vector from that region has similar small error. Such regions are called 
"flat minima". In MDL terminology, few bits of information are required to pick a 
weight vector in a "flat" minimum (corresponding to a low-complexity network) -- 
the weights may be given with low precision. FMS automatically prunes weights 
and units, and reduces output sensitivity with respect to remaining weights and 
units. Previous FMS applications focused on supervised learning [12, 13]. 
Notation. Let O,H,! denote index sets for output, hidden, and input units, 
respectively. For I 6 0 tO H, the activation yl of unit 1 is yl _ f (s/), where 
Sl -- Zm WlmY m is the net input of unit I (m 6 H for 1  0 and m  I for 1  H), 
Wtm denotes the weight on the connection from unit m to unit l, f denotes the 
activation function, and for m  I, ym denotes the m-th component of an input 
vector. W = I(O x H) tO (H x I)[ is the number of weights.

E = Eq + .kB is minimized by gradient descent, where Eq is the training set mean 
squared error (MSE), and A a positive "regularization constant" scaling B's in- 
fluence. Choosing A corresponds to choosing a tolerable error level (there is no a 
priori "optimal" way of doing so). B measures the weight precision (number of 
bits needed to describe all weights in the net). Given a constant number of output 
units, FMS can be implemented efficiently, namely, with standard backprop's order 
of computational complexity [13].

2.1 FMS: A Novel Analysis 
Simple basis functions (BFs). A BF is the function determining the activation 
of a code component in response to a given input. Minimizing B's term

obviously reduces output sensitivity with respect to weights (and therefore units). 
T1 is responsible for pruning weights (and, therefore, units). T1 is one reason why 
low-complexity (or simple) BFs are preferred: weight precision (or complexity) is 
mainly determined by 
Owij ' 
Sparseness. Because T1 tends to make unit activations decrease to zero it favors 
sparse codes. But T1 also favors a sparse hidden layer in the sense that few hidden 
units contribute to producing the output. B's second term

punishes units with similar influence on the output. We reformulate it: 
W log 
Few separated basis functions. Hence FMS tries to figure out a way of using 
(1) as few BFs as possible for determining the activation of each output unit, while 
simultaneously (2) using the same BFs for determining the activations of as many 
output units as possible (common BFs). (1) and T1 separate the BFs: the force to- 
wards simplicity (see T1) prevents input information from being channelled through 
a single BF; the force towards few BFs per output makes them non-redundant. (1) 
and (2) cause few BFs to determine all outputs. 
Summary. Collectively T1 and T2 (which make up B) encourage sparse codes 
based on few separated simple basis functions producing all outputs. Due to space 
limitations a nore detailed analysis (e.g. linear output activation) had to be left to 
a TR [14] (on the WWW). 
See intermediate steps in [14]. We observe: (1) an output unit that is very sensitive 
with respect to two given hidden units will heavily contribute to T2 (compare the 
numerator in the last term of T2). (2) This large contribution can be reduced by 
making both hidden units have large impact on other output units (see denominator 
in the last term of T2).

3 EXPERIMENTS 
We compare LOCOCODE to "independent component analysis" (ICA, e.g., [5, 1, 
4, 18]) and "principal component analysis" (PCA, e.g., [20]). ICA is realized by 
Cardoso's JADE algorithm, which is based on whitening and subsequent joint diag- 
onalization of 4th-order cumulant matrices. To measure the information conveyed 
by resulting codes we train a standard backprop net on the training set used for 
code generation. Its inputs are the code components; its task is to reconstruct the 
original input. The test set consists of 500 off-training set exemplars (in the case 
of real world images we use a separate test image). Coding efficiency is the average 
number of bits needed to code a test set input pixel. The code components are 
scaled to the interval [0, 1] and partitioned into discrete intervals. Assuming inde- 
pendence of the code components we estimate the probability of each discrete code 
value by Monte Carlo sampling on the training set. To obtain the test set codes' 
bits per pixel (Shannon's optimal value) the average sum of all negative logarithms 
of code component probabilities is divided by the number of input components. All 
details necessary for reimplementation are given in [14]. 
Noisy bars adapted from [10, 11]. The input is a 5 x 5 pixel grid with horizontal 
and vertical bars at random positions. The task is to extract the independent 
 In 
features (the bars). Each of the 10 possible bars appears with probability . 
contrast to [10, 11] we allow for bar type mixing -- this makes the task harder. 
Bar intensities vary in [0.1, 0.5]; input units that see a pixel of a bar are activated 
correspondingly others adopt activation -0.5. We add Gaussian noise with variance 
0.05 and mean 0 to each pixel. For ICA and PCA we have to provide information 
about the number (ten) of independent sources (tests with n assumed sources will 
be denoted by ICA-n and PCA-n). LOCOCODE does not require this -- using 25 
hidden units (HUs) we expect LOCOCODE to prune the 15 superfluous HUs. 
Results. See Table 1. While the reconstruction errors of all methods are similar, 
LOCOCODE has the best coding efficiency. 15 of the 25 HUs are indeed automati- 
cally pruned: LOCOCODE finds an optimal factorial code which exactly mirrors the 
pattern generation process. PCA codes and ICA-15 codes, however, are unstruc- 
tured and dense. While ICA-10 codes are almost sparse and do recognize some 
sources, the sources are not clearly separated like with LOCOCODE -- compare the 
weight patterns shown in [14]. 
Real world images. Now we use more realistic input data, namely subsections of: 
1) the aerial shot of a village, 2) an image of wood cells, and 3) an image of striped 
piece of wood. Each image has 150 x 150 pixels, each taking on one of 256 gray 
levels. 7 x 7 (5 x 5 for village) pixels subsections are randomly chosen as training 
inputs. Test sets stem from images similar to 1), 2), and 3). 
Results. For the village image LOCOCODE discovers on-center-off-surround hidden 
units forming a sparse code. For the other two images LOCOCODE also finds appro- 
priate feature detectors -- see weight patterns shown in [14]. Using its compact, 
low-complexity features it always codes more efficiently than ICA and PCA.

LOCOCODE's, however, are found automatically (we always start with 25 HUs). The 
final J columns show the coding efficiency measured in bits per pixel, assuming the 
real-valued HU activations are partitioned into 10, 20, 50, and 100 discrete inter- 
vals. LOCOCODE codes most efficiently. 
4 CONCLUSION 
According to our analysis LOCOCODE attempts to describe single inputs with as few 
and as simple features as possible. Given the statistical properties of many visual 
inputs (with few defining features), this typically results in sparse codes. Unlike 
objective functions of previous methods, however, LOCOCODE's does not contain 
an explicit term enforcing, say, sparse codes -- sparseness or independence are not 
viewed as a good things a priori. Instead we focus on the 5nformation-theoretic 
complexity of the mappings used for coding and decoding. The resulting codes 
typically compromise between conflicting goals. They tend to be sparse and exhibit 
low but not minimal redundancy -- if the cost of minimal redundancy is too high. 
Our results suggest that LOCOCODE'S objective may embody a general principle of 
unsupervised learning going beyond previous, more specialized ones. We see that 
there is at least one representative (FMS) of a broad class of algorithms (regularizers 
that reduce network complexity) which (1) can do optimal feature extraction as a 
by-product, (2) outperforms traditional ICA and PCA on visual source separation 
tasks, and (3) unlike ICA does not even need to know the number of independent 
sources in advance. This reveals an interesting, previously ignored connection be-

tween regularization and ICA, and may represent a first step towards unification of 
regularization and unsupervised learning. 
More. Due to space limitations, much additional theoretical and experimental 
analysis had to be left to a tech report (29 pages, 20 figures) on the WWW: see
