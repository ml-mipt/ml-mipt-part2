Abstract 
Cortical amplification has been proposed as a mechanism for enhancing 
the selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex. Less appreciated 
is the fact that the same form of amplification can also be used to de-tune 
or broaden selectivity. Using a network model with recurrent cortical 
circuitry, we propose that the spatial phase invariance of complex cell 
responses arises through recurrent amplification of feedforward input. 
Neurons in the network respond like simple cells at low gain and com- 
plex ceils at high gain. Similar recurrent mechanisms may play a role 
in generating invariant representations of feedforward input elsewhere in 
the visual processing pathway. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Synaptic input to neurons in the primary visual cortex is primarily recurrent, arising from 
other cortical cells. The dominance of this type of connection suggests that it may play an 
important role in cortical information processing. Previous studies proposed that recurrent 
connections amplify weak feedforward input to the cortex (Douglas et al., 1995) and selec- 
tively amplify tuning for specific stimulus characteristics, such as orientation or direction 
of movement (Douglas et al., 1995; Ben-Yishai et al., 1995; Somers et al., 1995; Sompolin- 
sky and Shapley, 1997). Cortical cooling and shocking experiments provide evidence that 
there is cortical amplification through recurrent connections, but they do not show increases 
in orientation or direction selectivity as a result of this amplification (Ferster et al., 1996; 
Chung and Ferster, 1998). Recurrent connections can also decrease neuronal selectivity 
through the same form of amplification, generating responses that are insensitive to certain 
stimulus features. Although the ability to sharpen tuning may be an important feature in 
cortical processing, the capacity to broaden tuning for particular stimulus attributes is also 
desirable. 
Neurons in the primary visual cortex can be divided into two classes based on their re-

sponses to visual stimuli such as counterphase and drifting sinusoidal gratings. Sim- 
ple cells show tuning for orientation, spatial frequency, and spatial phase of a grating 
(Movshon et al., 1978a). Complex cells exhibit orientation and spatial frequency tun- 
ing, but are insensitive to spatial phase (Movshon et al., 1978b). A counterphase grating, 
s(x, t) = cos(Kx - ) cos(t), is one in which the spatial phase, , and spatial frequency, 
K, are held constant but the contrast, s(x, t), varies sinusoidally in time at some frequency 
. In response to a counterphase grating, the activity of a simple cell oscillates at the same 
frequency as the stimulus, . A complex cell response is modulated at twice the frequency, 
2. To create a drifting grating of frequency , s(x, t) = cos(Kx - t), the spatial phase 
and spatial frequency are held constant but the grating is moved at velocity ,/K. A simple 
cell response to a drifting grating is highly modulated at frequency v, while a complex 
cell response to a drifting grating is elevated but relatively unmodulated. The differences 
between complex and simple cell responses are a direct consequence of the complex cell 
spatial phase insensitivity. 
Previous models of complex cells generate spatial-phase invariant responses through con- 
verging sets of feedforward inputs with a wide range of spatial phase preferences but similar 
orientation and spatial frequency selectivities (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Mel et al., 1998). 
These models do not incorporate recurrent connections between complex cells, which are 
known to be particularly strong (Toyama et al., 1981). We propose that the spatial phase 
invariance of complex cell responses can arise from a broadening of spatial phase tuning 
by cortical amplification (Chance et al., 1998). The model neurons exhibit simple cell be- 
havior when weakly coupled and complex cell behavior when strongly coupled, suggesting 
that the two classes of neurons in the primary visual cortex may arise from the same basic 
cortical circuit. 
2 THE MODEL 
The activity of neuron i in the model network is characterized by a firing rate r. Each 
neuron sums feedforward and recurrent input and responds as described by the standard 
rate-model equation 
dr 
rr dt = I + y Wjrj - r. 
Ii represents the feedforward input to cell i, W O is the weight of the synapse from neuron 
j to neuron i, and r,- is a time constant. Previous studies have suggested that, for a neuron 
receiving many inputs, r,- is small, closer to a synaptic time constant than the membrane 
time constant (Ben-Yishai et al., 1995; Treves, 1993). Thus we choose r,- = 1 ms. 
The feedforward input describes the response of a simple cell with a Gabor receptive field 
I = dxG(x) dt'H(t')s(z,t - t' , 
+ 
where s(x, t) represents the contrast function of the visual stimulus and the notation [ ]+ 
indicates rectification. The temporal response function is (Adelson and Bergen, 1985) 
H(t,)=exp(_ct,)((ct') 5 (øt') ? ) 
15! 7! ' 
where we use a = I/ms. The spatial filter is a Gabor function, 
(7 = exp  cos(kix - bi), 
where a determines the spatial extent of the receptive field, k is the preferred spatial 
frequency, and bi is the preferred spatial phase. The values of bi are equally distributed 
92 F. S. Chance, S. B. Nelson and L. F. Abbott 
over the interval [-180 ø, 180ø). To give the neurons a realistic bandwidth, ai is chosen 
such that kio'i = 2.5. Initially we consider a simplified case in which ki = 1 for all cells. 
Later we consider the spatial frequency selectivity of neurons in the network and allow the 
value of ki tO range from 0 to 3.5 cycles/deg. 
In this paper we assume that the model network describes one orientation column of the 
primary visual cortex, and thus all neurons have the same orientation tuning. All stimuli 
are of the optimal orientation for the network. 
Spatial phase tuning is selectively broadened in the model because the strength of a recur- 
rent connection between two neurons is independent of the spatial phase selectivities of 
their feedforward inputs. In the model with all ki -- 1, the recurrent input is determined by 
g 
Wij - (N- 1)' 
for all i  j. N is the number of cells in the network, and 0 _< g < gmaz, where gmaz is 
the largest value of g for which the network remains stable. In this case graax ---- 1. 
3 RESULTS 
The steady-state solution of the rate-model equation is given by ri ---- Ii q- E Wij'j' TO 
solve this equation, we express the rates and feedfoward inputs in terms of a complete set 
of eigenvectors ½' of the recurrent weight matrix,  Wij] = Xt,½' for  = 1, 2,..., N, 
where X are the eigenvalues. The solution is then 
ri = E 1 - X 
t=i 
This equation displays the phenomenon of cortical amplification if one or more of the 
eigenvalues is near one. If we assume only one eigenvalue, Xl, is close to one, the factor 1 - 
Xl in the denominator causes the  = 1 term to dominate and we find ri m i x  IjJ (1 - 
Xl) -1. The input combination  Ijj 1. dominates the response, determining selectivity, 
and this mode is amplified by a factor 1/(1 - Xl). We refer to this amplification factor as 
the cortical gain. 
In the case where Wiy = g/(N - 1) for i  j, the largest eigenvalue is Xl -- g and the 
corresponding eigenvector has all components equal to each other. For g near one, the re- 
current input to neuron i is then proportional to Y,j [cos((I)- bj)]+ which, for large numbers 
of cells with uniformly placed preferred spatial phases ½i, is approximately independent of 
(I), the spatial phase of the stimulus. When g is near zero, the network is at low gain and 
the response of neuron i is roughly proportional to its feedforward input, [cos((I) - bj)] +, 
and is sensitive to spatial phase. 
The response properties of simple and complex cells to drifting and counterphase gratings 
are duplicated by the model neuron, as shown in figure 1. For low gain (gain = 1, top panels 
of figures 1A and lB), the neuron acts as a simple cell and its activity is modulated at the 
same frequency as the stimulus (a for counterphase gratings and t for drifting gratings). 
At high gain (gain = 20), the neuron responds like a complex cell, exhibiting frequency 
doubling in the response to a counterphase grating (bottom panel of Figure 1A) and an 
elevated DC response to a drifting grating (bottom panel, Figure lB). Intermediate gain 
(gain = 5) produces intermediate behavior (middle panels). 
The basis of this model is that the amplified mode is independent of spatial phase. If 
the amplified mode depends on spatial frequency or orientation, neurons at high gain can 
be selective for these attributes. To show that the model can retain selectivity for other

Figure 1: The effects of recurrent input on the responses of a neuron in the model network. 
The responses of one neuron to a 2 Hz counterphase grating (A) and to a 2 Hz drifting 
grating (B) are shown for different levels of network gain. From top to bottom in A and B, 
the gain of the network is one, five, and twenty. 
stimulus characteristics while maintaining spatial phase insensitivity, we allowed the spatial 
frequency selectivity which each neuron receives from its feedforward input, ki, to vary 
from neuron to neuron and also modified the recurrent weight matrix so that the strength 
of the connection between two neurons, i and j, depends on ki - kj. The dependence is 
modeled as a difference of Gaussians, so the recurrent weight matrix is now 
Thus neurons that receive feedforward input tuned for similar spatial frequencies excite 
each other and neurons that receive very differently tuned feedforward input inhibit each 
other. This produces complex cells that are tuned to a variety of spatial frequencies, but are 
still insensitive to spatial phase (see figure 2). The spatial frequency tuning curve width is 
primarily determined by ac = 0.5 cycle/deg and as = 1 cycle/deg. 
Cells within the same network do not have to exhibit the same level of gain. In previ- 
ous figures, the gain of the network was determined by a parameter g that described the 
strength of all the connections between neurons. In figure 3, the recurrent input to cell i 
is determined by W = gi/(N - 1), where the values of gi are chosen randomly within 
the allowed range. The gain of each neuron depends on the value of gi for that neuron. As 
shown in figure 3, a range of complex and simple cell behaviors now coexist within the 
same network.

feedforward input to a complex cell arises from simple cells. Measurements by Alonso and

three neurons as in A. 
Martinez (1998) support this circuitry. However, direct excitatory input to complex cells 
arising from the LGN has also been reported (Hoffman and Stone, 1971; Singer et al., 1975; 
Ferster and LindstriSm, 1983). Supporting these measurements is evidence that certain 
stimuli can excite complex cells without strong excitation of simple cells (Hammond and 
Mackay, 1975, 1977; Movshon, 1975) and also that complex cells still respond when simple 
cells are silenced (Malpeli, 1983; Malpeli et al, 1986; Mignard and Malpeli, 1991). In 
accordance with this, the weak feedforward simple cell input in the recurrent model could 
probably be replaced by direct LGN input, as in the feedforward model of Mel et al. (1998). 
The proposed model makes definite predictions about complex cell responses. If the phase- 
invariance of complex cell responses is due to recurrent interactions, manipulations that 
modify the balance between feedforward and recurrent drive should change the nature of 
the responses in a predictable manner. The model predicts that blocking local excitatory 
connections should turn complex cells into simple cells. Conversely, manipulations that 
increase cortical gain should make simple cells act more like complex cells. One way to 
increase cortical gain may be to block or partially block inhibition since this increases the 
influence of excitatory recurrent connections. Experiments along these lines have been 
performed, and blockade of inhibition does indeed cause simple cells to take on complex 
cell properties (Sillito, 1975; Shulz et al., 1993). 
In a previous study, Hawken, S hapley, and Grosof (1996) noted that the temporal frequency 
tuning curves for complex cells are narrower for counterphase stimuli than for drifting 
stimuli. The recurrent model reproduces this result as long as the integration of synaptic 
inputs depends on temporal frequency. Such a dependence is provided, for example, by 
short-term synaptic depression (Chance et al., 1998). Hubel and Wiesel's feedforward 
model (1962) does not reproduce this effect, even with synaptic depression at the synapses. 
We have presented a model of primary visual cortex in which complex cell response char- 
acteristics arise from recurrent amplification of simple cell responses. The complex cell 
responses in the high gain regime arise because recurrent connections selectively deam- 
plify selectivity for spatial phase. Thus recurrent connections can act to generate invariant 
representation of input data. A similar mechanism could be used to produce responses that 
are independent of other stimulus attributes, such as size or orientation. Given the ubiquity 
of invariant representations in the visual pathway, this mechanism may have widespread 
use.
